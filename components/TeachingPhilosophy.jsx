        Pragmatically, the scope and sequence of reading and writing assignments
        reflect my teaching philosophy in that I require students to draw upon
        both their personal experience and their knowledge acquired through
        academic inquiry. While many skills are necessary for “success” in the
        modern job market, none is more essential than the ability to create
        coherent artifacts (written or otherwise) based on definite objectives,
        fluid organization, and clear communication, as well as critical
        thinking. Both high school and college level composition classes build
        these exact skills in that they determine where students’ competencies
        lay as they enter study and then build those skills in to marketable
        assets through outcome-based assessments. Not every student is
        interested in becoming a professional writer, but every student is
        interested in developing his or her skills into competitive abilities in
        a diverse marketplace. As such, educators, especially in English and
        other humanities disciplines, have to recognize not only that students
        come from diverse backgrounds, but that they also have diverse
        objectives.

        In keeping with balancing both student and institutional objectives, my
        education philosophy aims to elevate marginalized voices, empower
        historically overlooked demographics, and provide such students with the
        tools to become lifelong learners through culturally responsive
        teaching. To that end, supplemental texts in the genres (such as mentor
        texts of writing projects or reader-response assignments) should
        represent these voices, whether they are voices from the First Nations,
        the working poor, or immigrant stories, along with other voices not
        mentioned here. When students are able to see themselves represented in
        course texts, they are better able to engage readily with the material.
        For example, I often use the essays “Working at Wendy’s” by Joey
        Franklin and “What’s Wrong with Black English?” by Rachel L. Jones to
        demonstrate both the rhetorical situations of these writers while also
        giving students a chance to reflect critically on the ideas the authors
        present. Because of this and similar approaches to composition, students
        can find pride not only in their own identity, but also in the work they
        produce while making connections in the classroom. If students know
        their instructors value their experience, they are more like to make
        meaningful contributions in the classrooms.

        {`English teachers at all levels have a responsibility to engage students
        in critical thinking, skill building, and civic engagement. The
        classroom is the ideal place for this because students across the
        socio-economic continuum interact, creating a learning environment that
        relies not only on curriculum, but also on what students bring to the
        classroom. This collaborative approach benefits both students and
        educators alike. For example, in a Speech and Debate class, I show a
        national championship winning speech given a few years ago by a Sikh
        student. Many students are unfamiliar with the Sikh religion and assume
        the student delivering the speech is Muslim, or Arab, or even African.
        After viewing the speech, students are given the opportunity to ask
        questions, and through their comprehension of the competitor's ideas,
        they come to a greater understanding of what Sikhism is relative to the
        speaker’s identity within American society. Furthermore, teachers need
        to communicate high expectations of respect and agency in the classroom.
        While it isn't the teacher's place to tell students what to think or who
        to be, it is the teacher's place to foster an environment of inclusion
        that is free from intimidation, discrimination, and intolerance. Making
        these expectations clear through modeled behavior, syllabus and policy
        emphasis, and text selection is imperative. Through active collaboration
        on projects like a school-wide student writing manual for Myers Park
        High School, curriculum vertical-alignment for 11th and 12th grades,
        course revisions and updates at Franklin University, and evaluating high
        school instructors for Franklin University’s College Credit Plus
        program, I have actively implemented teaching strategies to promote the
        above ideas. My focus is always a student-centered, responsive approach
        to both assessment and meeting standards because 21st Century society
        demands such engagement.`}
