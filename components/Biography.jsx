            Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, I have a B.A. in literature from
            Otterbein University and an M.A. in literature from Portland State
            University in Portland, Oregon. My teaching career began back in
            2009 at Columbus State Community College, and I have been at Myers
            Park High School since 2016. Additionally, since 2011, I teach
            online two courses at Franklin University as well as act as a
            Faculty Observer for Franklin Universityâ€™s College Credit Plus
            partners. As of Fall 2021, I will be teaching online courses at the
            Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University.

            My academic interests include critical theory, literature as
            propaganda (especially Orwell and Steinbeck), and composition.
            Starting this fall, I will also be teaching courses at the Center
            for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. At Myers Park, I
            normally teach English IV and Speech and Debate I, and serve as the
            12th Grade PLC Leader, though I have taught other levels as well. I
            also serve as the Congressional Debate coach for the Myers Park High
            School Speech and Debate Team.
