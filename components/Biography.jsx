          Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, I have a B.A. in literature from
          Otterbein University and an M.A. in literature from Portland State
          University in Portland, Oregon. My teaching career began back in 2009
          at Columbus State Community College, and I have been at Myers Park
          High School since 2016. Additionally, since 2011, I teach online two
          courses at Franklin University as well as act as a Faculty Observer
          for Franklin Universityâ€™s College Credit Plus partners. As of Fall
          2021, I will be teaching online courses at the Center for Talented
          Youth at Johns Hopkins University.

          My academic interests include critical theory, literature as
          propaganda (especially Orwell and Steinbeck), and composition.
          Starting this fall, I will also be teaching courses at the Center for
          Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. At Myers Park, I normally
          teach English IV and Speech and Debate I, and serve as the 12th Grade
          PLC Leader, though I have taught other levels as well. I also serve as
          the Congressional Debate coach for the Myers Park High School Speech
          and Debate Team.
