        Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, I have a B.A. in literature from
        Otterbein University and an M.A. in literature from Portland State
        University in Portland, Oregon. My teaching career began back in 2009 at
        Columbus State Community College, and I have been at Myers Park High
        School since 2016. Additionally, since 2011, I teach online two courses
        at Franklin University as well as act as a Faculty Observer for Franklin
        Universityâ€™s College Credit Plus partners. As of Fall 2021, I will be
        teaching online courses at the Center for Talented Youth at Johns
        Hopkins University.

        My academic interests include critical theory, literature as propaganda
        (especially Orwell and Steinbeck), and composition. Starting this fall,
        I will also be teaching courses at the Center for Talented Youth at
        Johns Hopkins University. At Myers Park, I normally teach English IV and
        Speech and Debate I, and serve as the 12th Grade PLC Leader, though I
        have taught other levels as well. I also serve as the Congressional
        Debate coach for the Myers Park High School Speech and Debate Team.
